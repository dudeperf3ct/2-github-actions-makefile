#### Github Actions

In the previous exercise, we saw how Makefile can be used to automate certain tasks but they are useful only when we deal with local changes. If we want to version control system like github, we want to make all the tests passes for any changes made by other collaborators.

In this exercise, we will automate the task of installing packages, linting, formatting and testing using github actions.

To see github actions, clone the repo, make minor changes and push the repo.

GCP build takes time as we run the test on different python version.
